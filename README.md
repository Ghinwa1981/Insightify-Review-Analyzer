# Insightify_Full: Advanced Sentiment \& Keyword Analysis App

Welcome to the **Insightify_Full** project!  

This application is designed to transform unstructured text data (reviews, comments, social media feedback, etc.) into actionable insights.  
It provides highly accurate **Sentiment Analysis**, **Keyword Extraction**, and **Pattern Exploration (Bigrams & Trigrams)** by leveraging high-performance local **Deep Learning models (BERT)**, and features an interactive web interface built with Flask.

## Features

* **Data Upload and Preview:** Upload `.xlsx`, `.csv`, or `.json` files to begin the analysis. Displays a preview of the uploaded data.
* **Intelligent Column Detection:** Automatically detects the main text/review column.
* **Advanced Sentiment Analysis (BERT):** Uses a local **BERT** model (via `transformers`) for high-accuracy sentiment classification (**Positive, Negative, Neutral**).
* **Keyword Extraction:** Extracts and ranks the most frequent and relevant keywords and concepts from the dataset.
* **Interactive Visualizations (Plotly):** Displays analysis results (sentiment distribution ,keyword frequency and pattern exploration) using engaging and rich **Plotly** charts.
* **Data Persistence (PostgreSQL):** Saves all analysis session logs and individual results permanently to a **PostgreSQL** database using Flask-SQLAlchemy.
* **Downloadable Report (PDF,CSV):** (Next planned feature) Generates a compressed ZIP file containing all results and prepared data tables.

## How to Run the App

To run the application with full functionality (including the powerful BERT model), you must run two separate servers: the **Flask App** and the **FastAPI BERT API**

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure your Python environment is active and install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.5
```


### 2. Configure and Initialize Database

Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and update the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI connection string in your app.py. Then, create the necessary tables:

```python
>>> from app import db, app
>>> with app.app_context():
...     db.create_all()
```


### 3. Run the BERT API Server

Open the first Terminal/Command Prompt window and start the sentiment analysis service. Keep this server running:

```bash
uvicorn bert_api:app --reload
```


### 4. Run the Main Flask App

Open a second Terminal/Command Prompt window and start the frontend application:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000 .

## 📂 Input Data Requirements

Supported File Formats: `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.json`.
Required Column: Your file must contain at least one text column (e.g., review, comment, text). The app automatically attempts to detect this column.

Supported Language: The current configuration is optimized for English text data to maximize BERT model accuracy.

## 📈 Visualizations Available

All visualizations are created using Plotly and offer full interactivity (zooming, hovering, toggling data).

1. Sentiment Distribution
*Type:* Interactive Pie Chart.
Displays the percentage breakdown of sentiment classifications (Positive, Negative, Neutral) determined by the BERT model.
2. Top Keywords Frequency
*Type:* Interactive Horizontal Bar Chart.
Shows the absolute frequencies of the most important keywords extracted from the cleaned text.
3. Pattern Exploration (Frequent Bigrams & Trigrams)
*Type:* Interactive Diverging Horizontal Bar Chart.
This visualization highlights the most common word patterns (bigrams and trigrams) found in the customer reviews.  
It helps uncover deeper linguistic structures such as repeated complaints, highly praised features, and recurring user experiences.  
The diverging layout visually separates positive, neutral, and negative pattern strengths, allowing for clearer interpretation and deeper insights.

## ⚙️ Core Files Structure

| File/Folder | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `app.py` | Main Flask entry point; handles routing, database configuration, and orchestrates the analysis. |
| `analyzer.py` | The main analysis class: contains the core logic for BERT and VADER analysis, and keyword extraction. |
| `utils.py` | Utility functions for file loading, column auto-detection, and the direct BERT integration. |
| `local_model_api.py` | Separate FastAPI server hosting the BERT model for local inference. |
| `templates/` | Stores HTML templates (e.g., results.html) for the user interface. |
| `static/` | Holds static files (e.g., styles.css) and client-side JavaScript for interactivity. |


***

## 💾 Data Persistence

The application uses PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy for permanent data storage.

- **AnalysisSession:** Saves upload metadata (filename, timestamp) and summarized results (keywords, sentiment counts,Diverging Sentiment).
- **SentimentResult:** Stores the individual analysis output (Label, Score, Clean Text) for every single text row.
